# Ayush Nayak's Backup Resume

So my website didn't work or was offline or broken or whatever. Unfortunate. Luckily, this is a backup!

## What is this?

This is my Resume, or honestly as a High Schooler I'd rather call it just like a list of achievements and an overview of me myself. 

## Programming Languages I know

Firstly a developer, personally, I know quite a few languages, and am pretty good at quickly picking up frameworks, as well as knowing how to develop in all sorts of environments.

I am proficient in Python 3, and know PyTorch, Jupyter, Numpy, SciPy, Keras and matplotlib as well as all the supporting libraries to build and process all sorts of ML data. Speaking of ML, I have done all sorts of ML projects from the gateway drug MNIST, to a CoreML,multiple model detection algorithm, to a genetics deep learning project with model reconstruction. I am also pretty good with C++, and have a good grasp of all the libraries as well as algorithmic, coding being a USACO Silver using mainly C++. While outside of emacs and vim and super perfect,algorithmic problems, I have not used C++ for much production wise, I have used its brother C#, in production environments (specifically Unity) and while that may not be, the most noble use of a language, I do know it well and how to build for applications and not just CLI.,I have used C mostly for arduino's and other low level stuff, but tend to prefer C++ when possible. As mentioned before, I have worked on iOS development, another introduction into production code, almost exclusively with Swift, and know how to work with native and 3rd-Party Swift Frameworks. For my genetics project as said above, I had to learn and have a good idea of scripting in R, mostly,through RStudio. I also can script in JavaScript, mostly in a website context, but also for other things, (though everyone knows how awful JS is so I like others would rather use *anything* else),Speaking of web developement, I have created many websites over the days, and am right at home,with not only the front end, but the back end, having used Flask, Django, SQL and PHP, and built,applications with all of them. I also have built with Azure, MongoDB and a host of other databases.,Of course after learning so much, I have acquired the skills to quickly pick up practically any framework,or language extremely quickly.
